---------

For upgrading from a previous version of Couch to version 1.4:

1.  Unzip 'couchcms-1.4.zip' file to your local system. 
    Within the 'couchcms-1.4' folder thus extracted will be found a folder named 'couch'.
    From within this 'couch' folder' -
    a.  Delete 'snippets' and 'uploads' folders.
    b.  Delete 'config.example.php' file.

2.  Rename the 'ckeditor' folder found in your *existing* Couch installation's 'includes' folder 
    to 'ckeditor_old' (or delete it completely).
    
3.  Upload the remaining contents of the 'couch' folder of step 1 to 
    your existing installation's 'couch' folder (or whatever you might have renamed it to).
    This way we'll be overwriting all existing Couch core files with the newer version
    while preserving anything you might have added to 'snippets' and 'uploads' folder.
    
4.  If you already have a commercial license for your website, 
    append the following line to your site's couch/config.php file:

        define( 'K_PAID_LICENSE', 1 );

IMP. If you have chosen as a security measure to rename the 'index.php' to something else, do
make sure to delete your existing renamed index.php and then rename the new index.php to your
name of choice.
